# week12_lab
Reposit for Week 12 LAb
I am not sure what this lab is supposed to do. It seems like a cruel joke. I do not enjoy taking 101 classes, and 
its my own fault that I didnt take this class when I first started school. The amount of time I have wasted in this class
with no real direction while simultaneously learning nothing is amazing. Truely an astonishing task. This class lacks direction,
meaning and purpose. It should die a slow and painful death and if anyone wants to learn how to program, they should forgo this class
and instead learn on thier own or at a bootcamp. It will be much cheaper, and the dread much less. I am ashamed of myself. 
I should have taken biology.
